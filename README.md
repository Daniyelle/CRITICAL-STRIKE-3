âœ¦ Hey there! Dani here. 
  `If you do end up using anything here for any CS revival project please do link this github repository as credit. `

local information = {
`one = This repository contains scripts from Critical Strike V3.00 which broke due to a roblox update around 5+ years ago.(june 22 2018),`
`two = All of the code sourced here is extremely outdated. You will need atleast some basic coding experience if you are planning to recreate CS3.,` }
                                                                                                                               
thank you.
